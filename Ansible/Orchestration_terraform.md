# Orchestration with Terraform 

Orchestration with Terraform refers to the process of using Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of cloud or on-premises infrastructure resources. This includes virtual machines, databases, networks, and other components necessary for running applications.

#### What is Orchestration ?

Orchestration is the coordination and management of multiple computer systems, application or services. 

Orchestration  helps you to streamline and optimise frequently occurring processes and workflows, which can support a DevOps approach and help your team deploy applications more quickly.

#### What is Terraform? 

Terraform by HashiCorp is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Allows you to define the desired state of your infrastructure and then automatically create and manage it which means it helps you express what you want your infrastructure to look like, and it handles the complexities of making it happen, automatically.

#### Why use it?

- Terraform automates the process of creating and managing infrastructure, saving you time and effort. This means you can spend less time on manual tasks and more on other important aspects of your project.
  
- You don't have to manually set up each component of your infrastructure. Terraform takes care of this based on the configuration you provide

- Since configurations are defined in code, there's less chance of human error compared to manually configuring each component.

- Automation - Automates the process of creating, modifying, and destroying resources. This saves time and effort compared to manual configurations, especially in complex environments.

- Version Control: Terraform configurations are written in code and can be version-controlled. This allows you to track changes, collaborate with team members, and revert to previous versions if needed.
  
#### Where can it be used?

Terraform is a cloud-agnostic tool, meaning it can be used to orchestrate infrastructure across various cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and others, as well as on-premises environments.

#### Who needs to use it?

DevOps Engineers, Cloud Engineers, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), and anyone involved in deploying and managing infrastructure can benefit from using Terraform.

#### Who owns it?

The ownership of Terraform manifests often falls under the responsibility of DevOps or Infrastructure teams. 

#### Why should you learn it ?

- Multi cloud support - This means you can use a single tool to manage infrastructure across different cloud platforms.

- Terraform integrates well with CI/CD pipelines. It allows you to automate the process of testing and deploying infrastructure changes, enabling rapid development cycles.

- Terraform can significantly speed up the process of provisioning and managing infrastructure. With just a few commands, you can deploy complex architectures.

- Terraform keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure. This state file helps Terraform understand which resources are already created and how they are configured.
